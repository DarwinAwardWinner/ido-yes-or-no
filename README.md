# ido-yes-or-no

Use ido to answer yes or no questions.

Many people do `(defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)`, but this can make
it too easy to answer important questions incorrectly with just one
key. Using ido gives you a compromise between the two: you still have
to hit enter to confirm, but you don't have to type out the whole
word. Two keypresses are required, a "y" or "n" followed by RET.

# Isn't this massive overkill? {yes | no}

`y RET`
